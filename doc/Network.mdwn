# Network infrastructure

## Networks

NOC operates a number of networks, available as tagged VLANs on the core
switches (one in each half of the hackerspace).  These networks are:

| Network    | VLAN id | Extra subnets    |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| Management |      23 | --               |
| IoT        |      33 | --               |
| Services   |      34 | --               |
| Public     |      36 | 89.106.211.32/27 |
| Guests     |     127 | --               |
| Members    |     128 | 89.106.211.64/27 |
| `0xFF`     |     255 | --               |


### Conventions

We use a number of conventions to make things more consistent:

- The DNS zone for a given network is `NET.realraum.at`, with the exception
  of the public services network (which has `realraum.at`);
- Networks using RFC 1918 IP space use the 192.168.VID.0/24 subnet;
- The gateway for a network is on the last IP for the subnet.



## WiFi

Each location has a single AP, `ap{0,1}.mgmt.realraum.at`, which provides SSIDs
for the management VLAN (`realstuff`) and the LAN (`realraum` and `realraum5`);
we use Ubiquity hardware running OpenWRT.


## Physical locations

The switches have hostnames `sw{0,1}.mgmt.realraum.at`, and the WiFi access
points are similarly `ap{0,1}.mgmt.realraum.at`. `0` denotes the main room, and
`1` denotes Wöhnung 2.


### Wöhnung 2

#### Raum 1

r1w2 has two fiber connections: one to the main room, and one to the radio room.
(We use fiber to avoid creating a ground loop between the locations.)

In r1w2, we have a rack hosting a number of devices:
- the patch panel and core switch (`sw1.mgmt.realraum.at`) for W2;
- the `alfred` virtualization server;
- miscelaneous devices:
  - RIPE ATLAS probe;
  - some Raspberry Pi belonging to members;
  - ...

**Note:** members setting up devices that only need power and network access
          should do so in this rack (or even better, run a VM or a container
          on `alfred`).


#### realfunk

realfunk receives the `0xFF` and LAN VLANs trunked on a single fiber;
the switch there, `sw2.mgmt.realraum.at`, provides untagged ports on either VLAN.

Moreover, there is a Funkfeuer node there; it *does not* advertise the realraum
SSIDs.


### Main room

The main room has its patch panel and core switch (`sw0.mgmt.realraum.at`) in
Cx. The patch panel has a fiber link to r2w1, and a copper link to an external
antenna for our link to Funkfeuer.

The network shelf in Cx also houses some important devices:
- `gw.realraum.at`;
- `smsgw.mgmt.realraum.at`, plus its mobile phone;
- the PoE injectors for `ap0.mgmt.realraum.at` and `sch24.r3.ffgraz.net`;
- `test.r3.ffgraz.net`, which is a test Funkfeuer node.

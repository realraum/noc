# Network infrastructure

## VLANs

NOC runs 2 core switches (one in each room), carrying a bunch of VLANs:
- 33 is the management VLAN (192.168.33.0/24);
- 127 is the LAN (192.168.127.0/24);
- 255 (`0xFF`) is our Funkfeuer VLAN.

The switches have hostnames `sw{0,1}.mgmt.realraum.at`, and the WiFi access
points are similarly `ap{0,1}.mgmt.realraum.at`. `0` denotes the main room, and
`1` denotes Wöhnung 2.


## WiFi

Each location has a single AP, `ap{0,1}.mgmt.realraum.at`, which provides SSIDs
for the management VLAN (`realstuff`) and the LAN (`realraum` and `realraum5`);
we use Ubiquity hardware running OpenWRT.

Moreover, realfunk has an Archer C7 acting as a VLAN-capable switch
and as a Funkfeuer node; it does **not** provide the realraum SSIDs.


## Physical locations

### Wöhnung 2

#### Raum 1

r1w2 has two fiber connections: one to the main room, and one to the radio room.
(We use fiber to avoid creating a ground loop between the locations.)

In r1w2, we have a rack hosting a number of devices:
- the patch panel and core switch (`sw1.mgmt.realraum.at`) for W2;
- the `alfred` virtualization server;
- miscelaneous devices:
  - RIPE ATLAS probe;
  - some Raspberry Pi belonging to members;
  - ...

**Note:** members setting up devices that only need power and network access
          should do so in this rack (or even better, run a VM or a container
          on `alfred`).
          

#### realfunk

realfunk receives the `0xFF` and LAN VLANs trunked on a single fiber;
the switch there, `sw2.mgmt.realraum.at`, provides untagged ports on either VLAN.


### Main room

The main room has its patch panel and core switch (`sw0.mgmt.realraum.at`) in
Cx. The patch panel has a fiber link to r2w1, and a copper link to an external
antenna for our link to Funkfeuer.

The network shelf in Cx also houses some important devices:
- `gw.realraum.at`;
- `smsgw.mgmt.realraum.at`, plus its mobile phone;
- the PoE injectors for `ap0.mgmt.realraum.at` and `sch24.r3.ffgraz.net`;
- `test.r3.ffgraz.net`, which is a test Funkfeuer node.
